1. Enter Netflix in the search field
2. Choose option to search by trading partners or facilities
3. A graph with results is displayed. Is results are more than 10, there is a scrollable list on the right-hand side of the graph.  The search option is a dynamic search. You can start typing a letter to search for an object in the list.
4. Select an item from the graph to dig deeper. If there is a list on the right-side, user can select one of them to navigate the flow.

###`NOTES`: 
- Facility_canon_id field is displayed for facility in the chart to distinguish among them. All facilities have the same name. 
- Graph does not display all the search results since they can be in 100s and the graph would not be meaningful it's very cluttered.
